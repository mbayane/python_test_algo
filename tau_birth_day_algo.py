The cost of each black gift is  units.
The cost of every white gift is  units.
The cost to convert a black gift into white gift or vice versa is  units.
Determine the minimum cost of Diksha's gifts.

Example





He can buy a black gift for  and convert it to a white gift for , making the total cost of each white gift . That matches the cost of a white gift, so he can do that or just buy black gifts and white gifts. Either way, the overall cost is .
